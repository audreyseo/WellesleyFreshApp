Wellesley Fresh iOS App
=======================
##About
The Wellesley Fresh iPhone app takes information found on the [WellesleyFresh][1] website and makes it iPhone-friendly. This app was created by Audrey Seo, '20, for the students of Wellesley College.

##Features
This list is a summary of all of the app's current capabilities:
 - Show the menu of a given dining hall (Tower, Bates, Pomeroy, Lulu, Stone-Davis)
  - Use a drop-down type menu to choose which one
 - List the 3 closest dining halls to your current location
  - Provide easy access to their menus
 - Provides the hours of all the dining halls
  - Shows a progress bar that shows how much time has elapsed, percentage-wise
  - In between meals, shows how much time is left until the next meal
  - Gives time also over the weekends if you're Stone-Davis or overnight until the next time the dining hall will be open
 - Map shows your own location
 - Can select preference either for feet or meters
 - Only fetches data from WellesleyFresh once per day - saves time on load


###Features in Development
These are features planned for future releases:
 - Provide feedback to the dining hall
 - Add support for yards, miles, etc.
 - Connect "about" page to the app "about" button
 - Over the holidays/vacations, app should not say that the dining hall is open
 - Provide hours of operation for different establishments, i.e. El Table, the Emporium, the Leaky Beaker


###Possible Android Version
If you're a student at Wellesley who would like to work with Audrey Seo on creating an Android-friendly version of this app, please send them an email through your Wellesley google account.
