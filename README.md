Wellesley Fresh iOS App
=======================
[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/audreyseo/WellesleyFreshApp.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/audreyseo/WellesleyFreshApp)
##About
The Wellesley Fresh iPhone app takes information found on the [WellesleyFresh][1] website and makes it iPhone-friendly. This app was created by Audrey Seo, '20, for the students of Wellesley College. The app can be found in the Apple App Store [here][4].

##Features
This list is a summary of all of the app's current capabilities:
 - Show the menu of a given dining hall (Tower, Bates, Pomeroy, Lulu, Stone-Davis)
  - Use a drop-down type menu to choose which one
 - List the 3 closest dining halls to your current location
  - Provides easy access to their menus
 - Select a default dining hall to automatically load every time
 - Provides hours of all the dining halls
  - Shows how much time has elapsed, percentage-wise
  - In between meals, shows how much time is left until the next meal
  - Gives time also over the weekends if you're Stone-Davis or overnight until the next time the dining hall will be open
 - Provide hours of operation for different establishments, i.e. El Table, the Emporium, the Leaky Beaker
 - Map shows your own location
 - Can select preference either for feet, meters, yards, miles, and kilometers
 - Only fetches data from WellesleyFresh once per day - saves time on load
  - Also only fetches the new (as of January 2017) Wellesley Fresh menus once per week
 - About page
  - Can also redirect user to support email and github

###Features in Development
These are features planned for future releases:
 - Provide feedback to the dining hall
  - Connect it to whatever server they're using
 - Over the holidays/vacations, app should not say that the dining hall is open
 - Adapt order forms
  - Bagged lunch form for mobile app - make it easy to order one from your phone
  - Claflin Bakery
 - Show future/past (and therefore show what the date is)
  - Menus
  - Hours
 - Adapt nutrient information and such so that it can be shown with a disclosure indicator/detail disclosure button
  - Have option of showing detail disclosure button or not (because encouraging eating disorders in a stressful environment wouldn't be great)


###Possible Android Version
If you're a student at Wellesley who would like to work with Audrey Seo on creating an Android-friendly version of this app, please send them an email through your Wellesley google account.

##Development

*The below text is just a brief excerpt of all of the information about developing the Wellesley Fresh app. For more details, [click here][3].*

If you want to help out on this project, install the Git commandline tools, open Terminal, and in the directory of your choosing (hopefully one that you can remember), type this bit of code:
```
git clone https://github.com/audreyseo/WellesleyFreshApp.git
```
(or, instead of typing out the whole URL, just copy and paste [this link][2].

The project should be openable in Xcode, but let me know if it isn't.

Finally, waffle.io (click on the little badge at the top that says "Ready") manages issues for me, and I add the tag "complete" to issues that I've finished working on but haven't pushed to the main repo yet.

Also, if possible, if you are a Wellesley student and would like to help out, it would be cool if we could meet in person sometime.
