Wellesley Fresh iOS App
=======================
#About
The Wellesley Fresh iPhone app that adapts the information found on the [WellesleyFresh][1] website and makes it iPhone-friendly. This app was created by Audrey Seo, '20, for the students of Wellesley College.

##Features
These are all of the features the app is currently capable of:
 - Showing the menu of a given dining hall (Tower, Bates, Pomeroy, Lulu, Stone-Davis)
 - Listing the 3 closest dining halls to your current location
 - Showing the hours of all the dining halls
  - Providing a progress bar that shows how much time has elapsed, percentage-wise
  - In between meals, shows how much time is left until the next meal
 - Shows the menus of the 3 closest dining halls when the user chooses one
 - Map shows your own location
 - Can select preference either for feet or meters


###Features in Development
These are features planned for future releases:
 - Provide feedback to the dining hall, beyond just having buttons
 - Add support for yards
 - Add an "about" page to the app
 - Over the holidays/vacations, app should not say that the dining hall is open
  - Should give time also over the weekends if you're Stone-Davis until the next time the dining hall will be open
  - Should do this overnight as well

###Possible Android Version
If you're a student at Wellesley who would like to work with Audrey Seo on creating an Android-friendly version of this app, please send them an email through your Wellesley google account.
